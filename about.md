My name is Christopher and I build web applications and data work flows. I spend my free time hacking around with
open street map, pedestrian routing, and indoor web mapping. Python and Javascript are the bees knees, but I'm
slowly becoming a C# aficionado.

I'm currently hooking up Acuity Brands Lighting, inc with my mad skills as a Senior Application Developer. I primarily
build high throughput geospatial processing services and big data analytical engines.
