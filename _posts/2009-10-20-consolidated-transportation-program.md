<p>The Consolidated Transportation Program is the six year capital budget for transportation projects in the state of Maryland.</p>
<p>I completed digitizing the CTP for the years of 2008 and 2009 while employed with the <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://www.mdp.state.md.us/'>Maryland Department of Planning</a>. This project required the conversion of tabular data stored in PDF documents into an ArcMap compatible database. Upon completion of the digitization process, I performed an analysis determining how much state money will be spent on road projects inside and outside of the Priority Funding Area.</p>
