 <p>I have altered the formula so that elements with Z, M, and MZ values can now be parsed. I still have to figure out how google maps parses X,Y,M,Z values though. Also, I added in the ability to extrude an element from the function call. I still have to play around with these additions, but so far so good.</p><p><a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://www.bmoregeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wkt2kml_20091105.txt'>wkt 2 kml 20091105</a></p>
