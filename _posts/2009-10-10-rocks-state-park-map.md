<p>This is my last weekend at Rocks State Park. As much as it will be nice to have weekends free, I am still pretty sad that the season is over. I have a lot of good memories from this summer.</p>
<p>As you may know if I have spoken with you in the past month, I am entering an Online Trail Map of Rocks State Park for the Maryland Park Service inter-park web content contest. It took a little longer than I had hoped, but it wasn’t outside of my original time line. Let’s just say I have learned a bunch of stuff about building something like this from the ground up:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive your GPS unit in the mail one day after your scheduled day</li>
<li>Later summer weather in Maryland is crummy</li>
<li>Unbalanced quotation marks are a killer</li>
<li>Floats are great, but IE throws a fit sometimes</li>
</ul>
<p>I turned in the project yesterday. I’m probably going to work on it off and on over the next couple weeks. I would like to add some Lightbox effects and sharpen up the UI.</p>
<p>So here is a link to the project on my web space<a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://bmoregeo.com/admin/blog/blogpost/add/'>[link]</a>. Hopefully within the next 3 weeks I will have a link to the map on the Maryland Park Service web site.</p>
