<p>Apparently the cameras will nail you if you are going 12 miles an hour or over the speed limit. The program will start on October 1, 2009 with a grace period of 30 days (about the entire month of October) in which you will recieve a warning in the mail. After that grace period you will recieve a $40.00 ticket in the mail. Do not worry though, you wont recieve points and your insurance company will not be notified. However, these speed cameras are almost entirely located next to red light cameras. In other words, don’t speed through yellow lights in order to avoid the red light camera.</p>
<p>Here are the locations of those cameras to the best of my knowledge.</p>
