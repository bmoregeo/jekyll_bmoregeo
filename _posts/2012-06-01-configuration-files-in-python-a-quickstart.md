 <p>A large part of my job is taking mundane manual processes that people hate to do and writing a utility that replaces that function.  The one I’m most amped about right now is a Auto-Map caching utility.  You throw in a rest end point and it kicks off a cache.  This is good and all, but how do you make a utility that allows the user to modify what map caches to generate without modifying any actual code?  Configuration Files!  Yes the oldest trick in the book.  Here is a quick rundown on my favorite Python Config Parser library <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' title='ConfigObj' href='http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html'>ConfigObj</a>.</p><p> </p>
