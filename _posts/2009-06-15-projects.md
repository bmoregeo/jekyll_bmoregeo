 <p>I finished uploading most of my projects into the <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://bmoregeo.com/portfolio'>projects</a> section of the website. There will be some changes to the projects section in the next couple days to make it load a bit faster.</p><p> </p>

<p>I finished uploading most of my projects into the <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://bmoregeo.com/portfolio'>projects</a> section of the website. There will be some changes to the projects section in the next couple days to make it load a bit faster.</p>
<p>In other news, I am working on a couple fun projects. First, I will be developing a data resources section of the site. I have found over the years that data collection is probably the hardest part of most GIS projects. <em>Unless of course you are the sucker making the data. </em>I’ve found some pretty good resources over the years would love to share them with you and myself at a later date.</p>
<p>I am also trying to develop a better understanding of google maps / php / mysql / ajax development. Dynamic mapping is the future, or at least that is what most employers seam to be looking for. Regardless, google maps provides an excellent medium for cartographic display. I would like to figure out how to produce a web based geographic information system. This would involve connecting a map front-end (google maps) to a database (mysql) programatically with php and javascript.</p>
<p>The job search has officially official begun as I have finished my projects and resume sections on the site.</p>
<p>Thanks again for stopping by,</p>
