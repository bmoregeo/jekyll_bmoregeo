<p>To blow off some steam I decided to spend a few hours (4 so far) making a map for my favorite board game- RISK. My map is based off of Freddy Heineken’s division of Europe into Eurotopia. After reading <a href='http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/386-my-kingdom-for-a-beer-heinekens-eurotopia/'>this</a> posting on one of my favorite blogs <a href='http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/'>Strange Maps</a> I decided I absolutely had to make his vision a RISK map reality.</p>
<p>So here you go! This is in Eurotopia .90. In other words, I may need to do some revisions on it in the near future. I have not printed it out and played this board yet so hopefully it is fun to play on.</p>
