<p>The past 7 months have been intense, which has resulted in me not having a lot of free time to update this here blog. However, I have had a number of posts on my companies blog, <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://blog.gisinc.com/author/christopherfrickegisinc/'>GIS Inc. Blog</a>.</p>
<p>In November of last year I transitioned into a new role with the company. I am now a Solutions Engineer in our State / Local division. In essence, I am brought in to assist our clients with their ArcGIS Servers and I help out writing geoprocessing routines. It is pretty awesome, but a lot more intensive than the Help Desk.</p>

Python/ArcPy is such a powerful language. Last month I gave a presentation on my work with python at<a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/arcobjectsdevelopment/archive/2011/06/29/Dev-Meet-Up-_1320_-Washington_2C00_-D.C_2E00_.aspx'>Esri’s Washington DC Dev Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>I plan on updating this more. I swear! I want to emphasize python and ArcPy downfalls and code patterns. Hopefully this will be a place where I can let off some steam when I finally tackle a problem</p>
