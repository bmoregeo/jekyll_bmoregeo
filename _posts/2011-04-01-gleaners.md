<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The world looks a little different through the window of a bus. Three-mile trips to the store can quickly turn into multi-hour affairs filled with missed connections and half hour waits in the rain.</p>
<p>This poster aims to provide Gleaners with insight on how well they are providing service to patrons that utilize public transit via the Smart Bus system.</p>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<ol>
<li>A 30 Minute walk time ( 1.5 miles ) was calculated.</li>
<li>For each Gleaners Location:
<ol>
<li>The closest bus stop and walking time for each bus route was calculated.</li>
<li>Distances were calculated between each origin bus stop and all other bus stops on the Smart Bus network.</li>
<li>Bus stops within a total 30 minute walking and transit time were selected out.</li>
<li>Finally, a walking service area was calculated for each destination bus stop.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Gleaners location walking service areas and the Destination Bus Stops walking service areas were then merged into a single Gleaners transit service area.</li>
<li>Finally this service area was put into ESRI Business Analyst to generate demographic reports.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Gleaners Food Pantry is well positioned for public transportation access. Seventy Two percent of the current population is within 30 minutes public transit time of a Gleaners location. All of the key demographics, except for Non-Hispanic White, are above the 70% threshold.</p>
<p>However, Gleaners should note the 2015 projection shows a steady decline across most variables. This is an indication that their key demographic is slowly moving out of their public transit service area.</p>
