<p>Each year my company GIS Inc puts together a ‘Maps and Apps’ competition for a charitable cause. This year, I had the honor to work on application for the <a href="http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org">Wounded Warrior Project (WWP)</a>.</p>
<p>The wounded warrior project is a non-profit that assists wounded veterans with readjusting to life after their injury. It is a very good cause and I am really excited to help them out.</p>
<p>My application is a Congressional Tracker application built on <a href="http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/Sunlight_Congress_API/">Sunlight Labs congressional API</a> and the <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/">ArcGIS Javascript API</a>. This was my first foray with the Javascript API.</p>
<p>This application assists the WWP with determining concentrations of WWP members and which elected officials represent their district.</p>
