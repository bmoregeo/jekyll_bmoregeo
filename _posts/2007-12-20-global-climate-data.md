 <p>The data for this project was compiled from the <a style='color: #5eb80b;text-decoration: none' href='http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/stationlocator.html'>National Climatic Data Center Weather Observation Station Record</a>. Utilizing BASH and AWK scripting I downloaded, decompressed and summarized weather data from 1980 through 2007. Daily, monthly, yearly and total averages, maximums and minimums were calculated for the temperature, precipitation, snowfall, visibility, dew point and wind speed.</p><p> </p>

<p>The intent of this project was simply to compile the data for a member of the UMBC faculty. These maps were produced as quick examples of the available date.</p>
