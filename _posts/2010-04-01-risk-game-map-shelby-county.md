excerpt: >
 <p>I made this map for a cartographic challenge at my company, GISi. Unfortunately, I did not win the competition, but I did have a lot of fun making this map. ‘Continents’ were defined by economic zones within the county. These economic zones were determined by travel distance to the closest large town. This map is totally playable and even includes game cards. If you would like a sharper copy than the attached PNG, there is a 55MB pdf available.</p>
