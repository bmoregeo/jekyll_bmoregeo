 <p>This project was completed as a final project for Geographic Information Systems Database Design. I created a geodatabase to contain geospatial information on the natural areas of the UMBC campus. This included the individual environmental areas, the trail network and designated points of interest along the trail. Also, this geodatabase contained a tree inventory and tree diversity analysis for the UMBC campus.</p><p>Â </p>

<p>In this project, I walked through the development process. I developed logical, physical and relationship models for the natural areas. In addition, I included domains for easier data entry in ArcGIS. The metadata for this geodatabase was FGDC compliant.</p>
