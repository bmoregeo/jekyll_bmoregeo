<p>Over the past couple weeks I have spent some time working on the Trail Maps for Rocks and Susquehanna State Parks. I noticed that there are some errors in the php code I posted a couple months ago with regards to parsing the elevation. In the very near future I will be modifying this code further to pull the elevation value from the database.</p>
<p>My idea is that in the database there will be a SHAPE field for 2d geometric properties as well as a Z field for the third dimension.</p>
<p>Once I crank out a few more job applications I will get around to working on this.</p>
<p>Regardless, here is the updated code for converting WKT to KML.</p>
